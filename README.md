# Challenge 3: Dynamic Random Password Generator

## Description
An employee that has access to sensitive data might need to create a secure password that helps them protect the information they are working with. This project prompts the user to select up to four character types (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters) to include in their password. The output is a randomized password of a user-selected length, which can be used for login credentials. I learned how to use unicode to represent special characters, prompt the user until valid input is given, and work with an array of arrays.
